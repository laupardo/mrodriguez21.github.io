# Mariana Rodriguez's personal website

## Objective
This is the first project for the Web Developent class at Universidad de los Andes, Bogota (Colombia). The objective was to create a simple webpage containing useful information for potential employers, using what we've learned of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS these past two weeks.

### Technologies used
A first html/CSS website was written to list and provide all information and contents needed in the website (basic styling). Then, Bootstrap was added and used to create a navigation bar header and a few other interactive features. Finally, JS was used to do the typing effect on the home page.

## Prerequisites
This website is self-contained. All contents, from Bootstrap to Javascript, are included as links in the project's files. You'll only need a text editor and a web browser to use it and modify it.
